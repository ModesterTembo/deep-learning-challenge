# deep-learning-challenge
Project Overview
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. This project leverages machine learning and neural networks to create a binary classifier that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The dataset includes the following columns:

EIN: Employer Identification Number

NAME: Organization name

APPLICATION_TYPE: Alphabet Soup application type

AFFILIATION: Affiliated sector of industry

CLASSIFICATION: Government organization classification

USE_CASE: Use case for funding

ORGANIZATION: Organization type

STATUS: Active status

INCOME_AMT: Income classification

SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS: Special considerations for application

ASK_AMT: Funding amount requested

IS_SUCCESSFUL: Whether the funding was used effectively

Preprocessing
Dropped non-beneficial ID columns: EIN and NAME.

Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

Normalized numerical features using StandardScaler.

Model Architecture
Input Layer: Number of input features after one-hot encoding.

Hidden Layers:

First hidden layer with 32 nodes and ReLU activation.

Second hidden layer with 16 nodes and ReLU activation.

Output Layer: One node with sigmoid activation for binary classification.

Model Compilation
Optimizer: Adam

Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy

Metrics: Accuracy

Training
Epochs: 50

Batch Size: 32

Validation Data: 20% of the dataset

Evaluation
The model was evaluated on the test data with the following results:

Loss: [model_loss]

Accuracy: [model_accuracy]
